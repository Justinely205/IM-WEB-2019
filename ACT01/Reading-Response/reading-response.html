<p class="question">What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? </p>

<p>Lialina explained other people's views on the word User, mainly people who believe the word "User" had a negative connotation. Don Norman addressed we design for people not users which makes me think that users are like robots and saying that it is boring and mechanical, but instead it should be an experience. People shouldn’t be thinking about the computer they are using but the activity or task they are doing. After she briefs on the negative notions of the word User. She says that although she agrees with what they are saying, she believes that being a user is in fact a good thing and actually beneficial to the tech world. Computers and programs are built with the User's best interest in mind. She explains that Users exist prior to the computers and users are the ones the drives the imagination of the existence of the computer.</p>

<p class="question"> What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</p>
<p>Lialina's named her ideal internet user, The General Purpose User, Universal User and Turing Complete User, which was inspired by the Universal Machine by Alan Turing. It refers to a user that can accomplish their tasks regardless of what program they are given. Her Ideal user would be able to complete their task without a program specifically made for it. Some qualities she mentioned is informing the world about your activity without using a social media platform, which is made for sharing to the public. She uses the example of creating your own website to post about your breakfast in appose to your twitter feed, and your website homepage in appose to your twitter profile. Or logging into two account simultaneously by using two different browsers instead of using an existing app that can manage two accounts at once. </p>

 <p class="question"> From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</p>

<p>Gaming can be an example where the "gaps are filled by users". The game is developed my developers with the users as their sole goal. I, the user, would have to create an account and profile that requires me to fill in my information so that I am a registered user in their database. I mean almost every gaming site or websites in general, requires you to create a "Username". Multiple players would simultaneously play together. Based off what Lialina stated, this creates a distinction between the two class of people, the users and the developers. Without the users the game would not exist or be functional.</p>
