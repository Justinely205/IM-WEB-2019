<p class="question">1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry? </p>

<p>In Seu's opening Paragraph I think she is trying to communicate the idea of not using our conventional tools the way they're suppose to be used. But to use them as a medium to do something out of the ordinary, something that it wasn't created for. I think she connects it with the word poetry by saying that by using our 'tools' in an unconventional way, we are able to create something beautiful, unique and visually stimulating. By using the word poetic, just like poetry, words are used in a strategic, individualized and symbolic way; it communicates that we should approach these digital tools in the same way to design/create things in a meaningful and intentional way.</p>
<br>
 
<p class="question">2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</p>
<p>

	<p>Regeneration</p>


<p>In Seu's category regeneration, it is fairly straight-forward. It is essentially repetitively reconstructing a certain element in a new different way. The element is constant but reappears with a new quality. In the examples provided in Seu's text, the elements that 'regenerates' remain relatively the same but they re-spawn in a different position or with slightly different letters. In the websites that I mentioned, depending on my interaction with the web page, more elements appear.</p>

<p>If I click on the webpage, the eyeballs will appear on the location that I interacted with.</p>

 <p>As I hover over the circles, the circles will divide into another four circles until they form a photo of a koala. So cute. </p>
